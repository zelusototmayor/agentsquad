# AgentSquad - Product Walkthrough Script

## Introduction (0:00-0:30)
Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to walk you through AgentSquad, a new platform that lets you create, customize, and share AI agents that work together as your personal productivity team.

If you've ever felt limited by using a single AI assistant for all your different tasks, AgentSquad is designed for you. Let's dive in and see how it works.

## Homepage Overview (0:30-1:00)
This is the AgentSquad homepage. As you can see, it's designed to be clean and intuitive. The main navigation includes options for creating agents, managing your squad dashboard, and exploring the marketplace.

The homepage highlights our core concept: specialized AI agents working together to enhance your productivity.

## Agent Creation (1:00-2:30)
Let's start by creating a new agent. I'll click on "Create Agent" in the navigation bar.

Here on the agent creation page, we can define everything about our new AI agent:
- First, we'll give it a name. Let's call this one "Research Assistant"
- Next, we'll add a description: "Specialized in gathering information from various sources and summarizing findings"
- Now we select a role. I'll choose "Researcher" from these predefined roles
- The system prompt is where the magic happens. This is where we define exactly how our agent should behave and respond
- We can also select specific functions our agent can perform, like searching the web or summarizing content
- Finally, we'll add some tags to help others find this agent if we decide to share it

Once we're happy with our configuration, we click "Create Agent" and it's added to our squad.

## Squad Dashboard (2:30-4:00)
Now let's look at the Squad Dashboard. This is where you manage all your agents.

As you can see, I already have a few agents in my squad:
- The Research Assistant we just created
- A Content Writer for creating engaging content
- A Code Assistant for programming tasks
- And a Data Analyst for examining data and providing insights

Each agent has a toggle switch that lets you activate or deactivate them. You can also see key information like their role, description, and tags.

The Squad Dashboard also shows you statistics about your agents, like how many are active and how many interactions you've had.

## Marketplace (4:00-5:30)
Next, let's explore the Marketplace. This is where you can discover agents created by other users.

You can filter agents by role, sort by popularity or rating, and search for specific capabilities.

Each agent card shows you:
- The agent's name and role
- A description of what it does
- Tags for quick identification
- Rating and download statistics
- And a download button to add it to your squad

Let's download this "Data Visualization Specialist" agent. With just one click, it's added to my squad and ready to use.

## Sharing Agents (5:30-6:30)
Now, let's see how easy it is to share agents with others.

I'll go back to my Squad Dashboard and click "Share" on my Research Assistant agent.

On this page, you can:
- Get a shareable link to send to others
- Share directly to social media platforms
- Export the agent configuration as JSON for backup or advanced customization

This makes it easy to collaborate with teammates or contribute to the community.

## Coming Soon Features (6:30-7:15)
Before we wrap up, I want to highlight some exciting features that are coming soon:

- Team collaboration tools for working together with shared agent squads
- Agent challenges where you can test and improve your agents' capabilities
- An analytics dashboard to track performance and get insights
- And even more advanced customization options

## Conclusion (7:15-8:00)
