## Tagline
Build your AI agent team to supercharge your productivity

## Description
AgentSquad is a platform that lets you create, customize, and share AI agents that work together as your personal productivity team.

In today's AI-powered world, we're drowning in generic AI tools that try to do everything but excel at nothing. AgentSquad takes a different approach: specialized AI agents that collaborate to handle different aspects of your workflow.

**Key Features:**

â€¢ **Create Specialized Agents**: Design AI agents with specific roles like researcher, writer, coder, or analyst, each with tailored capabilities.

â€¢ **Build Your Squad**: Assemble a team of agents that work together, sharing information and collaborating on complex tasks.

â€¢ **Agent Marketplace**: Discover and download pre-configured agents created by other users, or share your own custom agents.

â€¢ **Customizable Prompts**: Fine-tune your agents with custom prompts and functions to perfectly match your specific needs.

â€¢ **Easy Sharing**: Share your agents with colleagues or the community with a simple link.

AgentSquad is perfect for knowledge workers, creators, developers, and anyone looking to enhance their productivity with AI. Instead of a single AI assistant trying to be everything to everyone, build a squad of specialized agents that excel at their individual roles.

We're just getting started with AgentSquad. Coming soon: team collaboration features, agent challenges, analytics dashboard, and more advanced customization options.

Try AgentSquad today and experience the power of a specialized AI team working for you!

## First Comment
Hi Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm thrilled to introduce AgentSquad to the community today. The idea came from my own frustration with trying to use a single AI assistant for everything. Some tasks need deep research, others need creative writing, and others need technical expertise.

AgentSquad lets you build a team of specialized AI agents that work together, each focusing on what they do best. Think of it as assembling your dream team of AI assistants.

I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions you might have. And if you create any cool agents, please share them with the community!

Thanks for checking out AgentSquad!
